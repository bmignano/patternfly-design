# File Upload


## Overview

The file upload pattern allows users to upload single or multiple files. This component has two main ways to interact with it: browsing for a file within a file directory or dragging and dropping a file.

This pattern has the optional feature of showing a read only or editable preview of the uploaded file.

#### Use Cases

This pattern may be used in any case where a user must upload files. However, we do not recommend this as a replacement for the file select component built into many browsers that is displayed as a text field and a "Browse" button. These two patterns – the file upload pattern and the file select component – should never be used together.
